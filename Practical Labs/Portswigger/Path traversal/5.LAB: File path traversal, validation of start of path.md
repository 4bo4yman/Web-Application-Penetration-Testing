## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [5. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-start-of-path) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:


## Bypass basic path verification

#### Some applications may require that the user-entered file name begin with the expected root directory, such as /var/www/images. In this case, the required base folder can be included followed by the appropriate transition sequences.

### How to exploit it

##### If the application only verifies that the file name begins with the root folder without checking the rest of the path, an attacker could use this to exploit the vulnerability. Suppose the application requires the file name to start with /var/www/images, an attacker can include this part and then add jump sequences to access sensitive files.

#### Practical example

#### Basic path verification status

#### Suppose the application has the following code to check the file name:


```
if filename.startswith('/var/www/images'):
    full_path = filename
else:
    full_path = '/var/www/images/' + filename
```

In this case, an attacker could include the base path and then add transition sequences:

```
filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

## Realistic scenario

#### Imagine there is a web application that allows users to upload images, and the application makes sure that the file name begins with the root folder ```/var/www/images```. An attacker can exploit this to access sensitive files.

#### Like this:

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

### Result: The attacker gains access to the sensitive file /etc/passwd.

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:


### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```26.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd```

```
?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
