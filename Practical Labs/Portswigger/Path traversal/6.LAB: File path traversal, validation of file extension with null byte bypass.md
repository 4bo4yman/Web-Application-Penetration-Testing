## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [6. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-file-extension-null-byte-bypass) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Use ```Null Byte``` to bypass extension verification

#### Some applications may require that a user-entered file name end with an expected file extension, such as .png. In this case, ```Null Byte``` (```%00```) can be used to terminate the file path before the desired extension.

### How to exploit Null Byte

#### ```Null Byte (%00)``` is a character that represents the end of a string in many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand operating systems. When used, the system or application ignores any texts that follow it. This property can be exploited to bypass extension verification.
##### Practical example
##### Extension verification status

##### Suppose the application has the following code to check the file extension:

```
if filename.endswith('.png'):
    full_path = '/var/www/images/' + filename
```

### In this case, an attacker could include a ```Null Byte``` before the requested extension:

```
filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
```

### Original entry: ```../../../etc/passwd%00.png```
##### Verification: The application verifies that the entry ends in ```.png```.
##### Result: The entire path is accepted but the text after the ```Null Byte``` is ignored, resulting in the final path:

```
../../../etc/passwd
```

# Let'a play this lab:

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:


### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```57.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd```

```
../../../etc/passwd
```

#### ok, No such file.


### Let's try ```Null Byte``` we konw that this parameter show images so ```extension of images```: 

```
../../../etc/passwd%00.png
```

or 


```
../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg
```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
