## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [4. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

### In some cases, such as when the path is used in a URL or in the filename parameter within a multipart/form-data request, servers may delete any cross-directory jump sequences before passing the input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this type of sanitization by using ```URL encoding``` or even ```double encoding``` of ```../``` symbols.


#### URL Encoding techniques

>URL Encoding

#### ```../``` becomes ```%2e%2e%2f```

### Double URL Encoding

#### ```../``` becomes ```%252e%252e%252f```

#### Non-standard encryptions

#### ```..%c0%af``` or ```..%ef%bc%8f``` may also work in some cases.

##### Use ```Burp Suite Pro``` to experiment with encryptions

#### For Burp Suite Professional users, Burp Intruder offers a preset list of payloads under the name Fuzzing - path traversal. This list contains some coded directory jump sequences you can try.


## Realistic scenario

#### Imagine that you are working on a web application that allows users to upload images. The application contains a mechanism to prevent ```../``` sequences. However, you can use encryption to bypass this mechanism:

##### If you send a request with the file parameter as follows

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
```

Or using double encryption:

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
````

### You can bypass input sanitization and access sensitive file.

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.
