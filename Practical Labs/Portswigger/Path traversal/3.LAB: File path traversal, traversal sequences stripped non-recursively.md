## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [3. Path traversal lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-sequences-stripped-non-recursively) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Use overlapping transition sequences

#### Some applications attempt to prevent Path Traversal attacks by removing or blocking transition sequences such as ```../``` and ```..\```. But attackers can use nested transition sequences to ```bypass these defenses```. Overlapping transition sequences revert to simple transition sequences when the internal sequence is removed.


## Overlapping sequences

#### ```....//```: When the internal sequence (```../```) is removed, the simple transition sequence (```../```) remains.
#### ```....\\```: The same idea, but on systems that use backslash (```such as Windows```).

### Practical example

#### Suppose there is an application that removes ```../``` sequences from inputs. An attacker could use nested sequences such as ```....//``` to achieve the same goal.

#### Original entry: ```....//etc/passwd```
#### After removing the internal relay ../ the input becomes ```../etc/passwd```

### How to exploit it

##### Imagine the application contains the following code to prevent Path Traversal attacks:

```
filename = user_input.replace('../', '')
```


### If the attacker enters ```....//etc/passwd```:

 The application removes the internal relay ```../```, leaving ```../etc/passwd```.
 Thus, the attacker gains access to the sensitive file ```/etc/passwd```.

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and search for all the existing parameters that we can benefit from, such as:


### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```60.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd``` or ```/etc/passwd```

#### ok, No such file.

#### Also, No such file.

#### Let's try this:

```
....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
