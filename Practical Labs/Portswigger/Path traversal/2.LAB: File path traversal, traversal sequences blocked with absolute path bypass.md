## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [2. access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-absolute-path-bypass) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:


### Common barriers to exploiting Path Traversal vulnerabilities

##### Many applications that incorporate user input into file paths implement defenses against Path Traversal attacks. However, these defenses can often be bypassed.

##### If the application removes or blocks directory jump sequences (such as ```../```) from a user-supplied file name, it may be possible to bypass this defense using various techniques.


#### Ways to bypass defenses

#### Use absolute path:
##### You may be able to use an absolute path from the root of the file system, such as ```filename=/etc/passwd```, to directly point to a file without using any transition sequences.

##### Explain the scenario in a simple way

##### Imagine you have a web application that allows users to upload certain files. To avoid ```Path Traversal``` attacks, the application checks user input and removes any transition sequences such as ```../```.

##### For example, if the user enters ```../../etc/passwd```, the application converts it to etc/passwd, thus preventing the attack.

##### However, if the application does not check absolute paths, an attacker can use an absolute path to access the requested file directly, such as:

```
filename=/etc/passwd
```

### In this case, an attacker can bypass the defense and access the sensitive file directly.

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it.

### Well, we have found ```filename``` parameter that may be affected by a vulnerability


##### The value of filename is ```58.jpg``` we will instead to ```../../../etc/passwd```

```
?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```

#### ummm, the application removes or blocks directory jump sequences (such as ```../```) from a user-supplied file name, we will using this:

```
?filename=/etc/passwd
```

### Great, we were able to access that sensitive file
