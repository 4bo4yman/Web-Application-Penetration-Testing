## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [9. XSS lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-dom-xss-reflected) in ```portswigger```
### Let's play this lab:

#### First, we navigate inside the browser

### notice that the JSON response is used with an ```eval()``` function call.
##### By experimenting with different search strings, you can identify that the JSON response is escaping quotation marks. However, backslash is not being escaped.

To solve this lab, enter this code:

```
\"-alert(404)}//
```
