## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [4. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-race-condition) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Exploiting race condition vulnerabilities in downloading files and executing the file before deleting it
#### General steps to exploit the race conditions loophole:

### Upload the malicious file:
#### Upload a malicious file to the server. This file can be a PHP script or any other type of executable file.

```
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

#### Run a race to access the file:
#### Once the file is uploaded, you need to perform a race attack to access and execute the file before the server deletes it.

### Tools and techniques to carry out the attack:

#### Automate the attack using tools like Burp Suite:
#### You can use Burp Suite to automate multiple HTTP requests to access a file before it is deleted.

### Writing an automation script:
#### A script can be written in a programming language such as Python to execute a large number of requests very quickly to access and execute the file.


### Conclusion:

#### ```Race Condition``` Attacks: These are complex vulnerabilities that require good understanding of the server and speed of implementation.
#### ```Real-world applications```: In reality, these attacks can be used to access and execute malicious files before they can be verified or deleted by the server.

# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php echo file_get_contents("/home/carlos/secret"); ?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30fddda5-7167-4be3-9867-10c6f27ac0f1)


### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.

### Hmm, if you notice how long it takes for the server to respond to us, it takes more time.
#### This is because it adds our file to the server and then verifies whether it is safe or not
#### Then it deletes it. This process takes milliseconds, so we want to use an extension ```Turbo Intruder```
### But Let's find of Our file in server ```/files/avatars/tor.php```
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8416b20f-7528-4f95-82b7-463b13c41846)

### Ok, it is removed.

#### Let's run  ```Turbo Intruder``` , We need two request, first request about upload our file, Second request about run our file before remove it.

### Exploin for this scenario:

### But i forget this Host ;(
