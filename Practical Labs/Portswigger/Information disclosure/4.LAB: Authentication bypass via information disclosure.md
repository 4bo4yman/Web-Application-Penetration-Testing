### We hiddin header in response:

```
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 156.213.159.161
```

### We send request with GET method and add ```X-Custom-IP-Authorization``` header and modify to:


```
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
```

### We used that IP to trick the server into believing that the request was coming from a local IP and not an external one.
