## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [6- access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-method-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

### What does HTTP method mean?

#### The HTTP method is the type of request that you send to the server. There are several methods, such as ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, and ```DELETE```.
##### 1.```GET```: Usually used to get data from the server.
##### 2.```POST```: Typically used to send data to the server (such as when submitting a registration form).
##### 3.```PUT``` and ```DELETE```: Used to update or delete data on the server.


-----------

## Imagine our financial transfer situation: ```https://bank.com/transfer```.

#### The site expects a ```POST``` request to perform a money transfer.

#### The attacker attempts a ```GET``` request: ```https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to_account=12345```

#### **If the server does not verify the HTTP method**, the transfer may be performed as if it were a POST request.

# Let'a play this lap:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following admin credentials: ```administrator:admin```
#### Then navigate inside this path ```/admin```

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it. 
#### enter on ```Upgrade user```.

#### ok this control is success because we inside ```admin account```, we want this control but inside ```wiener account```.

### This request is from the admin account, so how can we copy it, but it is from the Wiener account?

##### Yes, we change the cookie with the **cookie value for wiener**, and thus we perform this operation, but from the wiener account

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following admin credentials: ```wiener:peter```

### ummm I went to the ```inspect```, then to the ```storage```, and saw in the ```cookie value``` and copy it.

#### this cookie is: ```G4ZzbQaCIFAqf9pBv9jQX9Bagm2EhCOZ```

### lets back to this request


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83a885e4-b2a6-42bb-aee9-5413f167742d)

### and change cookie to ```G4ZzbQaCIFAqf9pBv9jQX9Bagm2EhCOZ```

#### Ooppss... Our access to that page has been blocked. We are looking for any vulnerability to control access as if we were an admin

### Let's use today's technique and make a conversion ```POST``` method to ```POSTX``` Method.

### Now Let's use today's technique and make a conversion ```POST``` method to ```GET``` Method by ```right-clicking``` and selecting ```Change request method```.

## Well we did it. We're upgrading Our account ```wiener``` to celebrate the completion of the mission.

### ok enter ```Send```:
