## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [third access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-controlled-by-request-parameter) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:
### Parameter-based access control methods

##### Some applications specify access rights or role for the user when they log in, and then store this information in a place that the user can control. This location may be one of the following:

 - Hidden Field.
 - Cookie.
 - Preset Query String Parameter.

#### Imagine that you have a web application where regular users and administrators can log in.
#### If the user is an admin, they get a special link like ```https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true```.

## the problem:

#### Any normal user can change the link to ```https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true```.
#### This gives him access to administrative functions even if he does not have authority.

# Let'a play this lap:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```
#### Then navigate inside this path ```/admin```

#### Ooppss... Our access to that page has been blocked. We are looking for any loopholes to control access as if we were an admin

#### ummm I went to the ```inspect```, then to the ```storage```, and saw in the cookie that the administrator was ```false```.
#### Let's try change the value is administrator to ```true```.
