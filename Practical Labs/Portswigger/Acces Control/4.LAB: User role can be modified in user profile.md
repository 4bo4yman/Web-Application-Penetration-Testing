## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [fourth access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-can-be-modified-in-user-profile) in ```portswigger```

#### This lab is similar to the previous lab, but the difference between them is that the previous lab depends on a vulnerability inside the cookie that allowed us to change the variable values ‚Äã‚Äãto control the admin‚Äôs access, but today‚Äôs lab relies on the Preset Query String Parameter.



# Let'a play this lap:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```
#### Then navigate inside this path ```/admin```

#### Ooppss... Our access to that page has been blocked. We are looking for any vulnerability to control access as if we were an admin

<br>



#### ummm I went to the ```inspect```, then to the ```storage```, and saw in the cookie that the administrator was ```false```.
#### Let's try change the value is administrator to ```true```.

#### ummm I went to the ```inspect```, then to the ```storage```, But we didn't get anything interesting.

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it




#### We will go to the my-account page, change the email, and then intercept the request

#### Now we will copy all the variables and values ‚Äã‚Äãand add them inside our application, but change  ```roleid``` to ```2```:

```
"username": "wiener",
  "email": "mohamed@gmail.com",
  "apikey": "1MsXfKylXBYeRdRZO1pJyBC5WJeSoBiG",
  "roleid": 2
```

#### Now navigate inside this path ```/admin```

## Well we did it. We're deleting Carlos to celebrate the completion of the mission.
