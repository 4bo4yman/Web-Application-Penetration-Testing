## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [8. access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-unpredictable-user-ids) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:


#### Suppose we have a social networking application where globally unique identifiers ```(GUIDs)``` are used to identify each user instead of usernames. A GUID is like a unique number that is unique to each person, and is difficult to guess because it is random and unpredictable.

#### However, this GUID can appear in different places within the application. For example, if a user writes a message to another user in the application, the user's GUID may be clear in the message. This means that if an attacker can access this message, they may be able to see the other ```user's GUID```.

#### For a practical example, if you have an application such as a Public Comment Platform, where users can write comments on different topics, and GUIDs are used to identify users instead of their names, there could be a ```risk of GUIDs being exposed in comments```. If an attacker gains access to these comments, they may be able to see the GUIDs of other users and attempt to exploit this information for bad purposes.
