## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [third access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

# Broken access control resulting from platform misconfiguration

#### Some applications enforce access control at the platform level. It does this by restricting access to certain URLs and HTTP methods based on the user's role. For example, an application might configure a rule like this:

```DENY: POST, /admin/deleteUser, managers```

#### This rule prevents users in the managers group from using the POST method on the URL ```/admin/deleteUser```. Various things can happen in this situation that lead to access control bypasses.

#### Some frameworks support non-standard HTTP headers that can be used to override the URL in the original request, such as ```X-Original-URL``` and ```X-Rewrite-URL```. If the site uses strict front-end controls to restrict access based on the URL, but the application allows URL override via the request header, it may be possible to bypass the access control with a request like the following:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
X-Original-URL: /admin/deleteUser
```

### Scenario:

####  You have an application that prevents administrators from deleting users via a POST request to /admin/deleteUser.
#### The rule is configured as follows: DENY: POST, /admin/deleteUser, managers.

### the problem:

#### An attacker could send a ```POST``` request to ```/``` instead of ```/admin/deleteUser```.
#### In the request header, he can add ```X-Original-URL: /admin/deleteUser```.
#### This could allow an attacker to bypass the original rule and delete users even though they do not have permissions.



# Let'a play this lap:

#### Let's navigate inside this path ```/admin```

### We use the ```burp suite``` tool to help us intercept the request and modify it




#### We will go to the home page and intercept the request

### if we change ```GET / HTTP/2``` to ```GET /admin HTTP/2``` will respones ```Access denied```.

### But we will using ```X-Original-URL``` to bypass this error.

```
X-Original-URL: /admin
```

## Well we did it. We're deleting Carlos to celebrate the completion of the mission.

umm, there here problem, while deleting carlos respone ```Access denied``` So we intercept deleting request and changing it.


```
GET /?username=carlos HTTP/2
.
.
.

X-Original-Url: /admin/delete
```
