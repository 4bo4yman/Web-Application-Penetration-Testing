### Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [Second access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url) in ```portswigger```

##### In some cases, sensitive functionality is hidden by giving it a less predictable URL. This method is known as```Security by Obscurity```. However, hiding sensitive functionality does not provide effective access control, because users may discover the hidden link in different ways.



## example:
### Imagine an application that hosts administrative functions in the following link:

```https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556```

#### This link may not be easy for an attacker to guess. However, the app may leak the link to users. The link may be exposed in JavaScript code that builds the user interface based on the user's role.

## poge source:

```
<script>
	var isAdmin = false;
	if (isAdmin) {
		...
		var adminPanelTag = document.createElement('a');
		adminPanelTag.setAttribute('https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556');
		adminPanelTag.innerText = 'Admin panel';
		...
	}
</script>
```

#### First, we navigate inside the browser and see ```page source``` or ```inspect```:

Great we have the hidden path ```/admin-ibtanl```

Well, we can control it as an admin inside the site.

Let's delete carlos from this site ;)
