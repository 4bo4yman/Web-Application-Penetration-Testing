## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [10. access control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-password-disclosure) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:


# Horizontal to vertical privilege escalation


### Often, a ```horizontal privilege escalation``` attack can be converted into a ```vertical privilege``` escalation by gaining access to a user with greater privileges. For example, a horizontal escalation attack could allow an attacker to reset or compromise another user's password. If an attacker targets an administrative user and compromises their account, they can gain administrative access and thus perform vertical privilege escalation.

### Let's understand this with a practical example:

#### Suppose there is an application where users can access their account page using a link containing the user ID as in the following example:

```https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=456```

#### If an attacker can use parameter manipulation to access a user's account page, then if the targeted user is an application administrator, the attacker can access an ```administrative account``` page. This page may reveal the administrator password or provide a means to change it, or may provide direct access to functions that require special privileges.

#### This shows how a horizontal escalation attack can turn into a vertical privilege escalation attack when an attacker can compromise an account with higher privileges, enhancing the severity of the attack and allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or important functionality in the application.


# Let'a play this lap:

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

### Do you notice the Eddie ```id``` parameter in url? 

```https://0ad70061046de41286f33b9400c7005e.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener```

### Ok we will change value id from ```wiener``` to ```administrator```.

```
https://0ad70061046de41286f33b9400c7005e.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=administrator
```

Great, Now we have administrator account:

```
username: administrator
password: vg39g04suhy2m18rlm09
```


Let's go login in with admin's account.

## Well we did it. go to Admin panel then We're deleting Carlos to celebrate the completion of the mission.
