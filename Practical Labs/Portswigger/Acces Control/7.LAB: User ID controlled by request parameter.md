## Welcome, my friend. Today we will start the [7. access control lab](https://0ac400c803bb33fc8334ba1c00ab000e.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=carlos) in ```portswigger```

# Explain this Scenario:

# Broken access control resulting from URL-matching discrepancies.

#### This section concerns access control issues resulting from ```discrepancies in matching URL paths```. Websites may vary in how they match the path of an incoming request to the specific endpoint.

###  Example of problem:

#### Imagine a website that has a page to delete users:

#### Endpoint: ```/admin/deleteUser```
#### Request from user: ```/ADMIN/DELETEUSER```

## Scenario:

#### Some sites may accept the ```/ADMIN/DELETEUSER``` request and redirect it to ```/admin/deleteUser``` despite the difference in upper and lower case letters.
#### If the access control system is inflexible, it may consider these requests as different and not apply the correct restrictions, leading to security vulnerabilities.



## ```Spring``` framework and ```useSuffixPatternMatch``` feature

#### Spring framework is a popular framework for developing ```Java``` applications.

#### If the ```useSuffixPatternMatch``` option is enabled, it allows paths containing an arbitrary file extension to be matched with the equivalent endpoint without an extension.
### Example: A request to ```/admin/deleteUser.anything``` will match the ```/admin/deleteUser``` endpoint.

### the problem:

#### Before ```Spring 5.3```, this option was enabled by default, meaning developers may not be aware that this behavior could occur.

### Other discrepancies

#### On some systems, paths such as ```/admin/deleteUser``` and ```/admin/deleteUser/``` may be considered different endpoints.

#### An attacker may be able to bypass access control restrictions by adding a slash ```(/)``` at the end of the path.

### Practical example:

#### Protected endpoint:

```
 /admin/deleteUser
```

#### Regular order:

```
 /admin/deleteUser
```

### Request rate:

```
 /admin/deleteUser/
````

### If the system treats these paths as different endpoints, an attacker may be able to bypass security restrictions.

-----------------

# 2. Horizontal privilege escalation.


### Horizontal privilege escalation occurs when a user gains access to another user's resources instead of their own resources of the same type.

## Scenario

### Example:

#### An employee has access to other employees' records as well as his or her own.
#### This is a case of ```horizontal privilege escalation```, where a user gains access to other people's data.

### How to carry out the attack

#### The average user reaches his account page via the following link:
#### ```https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123```
#### The attacker changes the id value in the link to another user's ID:
#### ```https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=124```

### If there is no proper identity verification in the server, an attacker may be able to access another user's account, data, and functionality.



> [!NOTE]
> This is an example of an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability. This type of vulnerability arises where user-controller parameter values are used to access resources or functions directly.

#### Let's log in to your own account using the following credentials: ```wiener:peter```

### Do you notice the Eddie ```id``` parameter in url? 

```https://0a33008e037a22a183bff6b900fa001e.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener```

### Ok we will change value id to carlos.

```

## Well we did it. We're copy API Key of carlos and submit it to celebrate the completion of the mission.
