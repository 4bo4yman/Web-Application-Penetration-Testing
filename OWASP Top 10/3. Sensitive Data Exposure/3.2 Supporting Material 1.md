The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format that is easily accessible from many locations at once is in a database. This is obviously perfect for something like a web application, as there may be many users interacting with the website at any one time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax; however, alternative formats (such as NoSQL) are rising in popularity.

In a production environment it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers, running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These databases are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up a full database server, and so could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. Accessing a database server is outwith the scope of today's task, so let's focus instead on flat-file databases.

As mentioned previously, flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually this would not be a problem for a webapp, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files that a user connecting to the website is able to access)? Well, we can download it and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure indeed!

That is a big hint for the challenge, so let's briefly cover some of the syntax we would use to query a flat-file database.

The most common (and simplest) format of flat-file database is an sqlite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages, and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called "sqlite3", and is installed by default on Kali.

Let's suppose we have successfully managed to download a database:

To access it we use: 
```
sqlite3 <database-name>
```

</p> 

* We can see that there is an SQlite database in the current folder.
  ```sqlite3 <database-name>```:

</p> 

* From here we can see the tables in the database by using the ```.tables``` command:

</p> 

* At this point we can dump all of the data from the table, but we won't necessarily know what each column means unless we look at the table information. First let's use ```PRAGMA table_info(customers);``` to see the table information, then we'll use ```SELECT FROM customers;``` to dump the information from the table:

</p> 


We can see from the table information that there are four columns: custID, custName, creditCard and password. You may notice that this matches up with the results. Take the first row:

```
0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

We have the custID (0), the custName (Joy Paulson), the creditCard (4916 9012 2231 7905) and a password hash (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99).

In the next task we'll look at cracking this hash.
