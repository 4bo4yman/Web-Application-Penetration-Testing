<h1>$${\color{blue}Sensitive}\space {\color{blue}Data}\space {\color{blue}Exposure}$$</h1>

When a webapp accidentally divulges sensitive data, we refer to it as ```"Sensitive Data Exposure"```. 
This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc), 
but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. At more complex levels this often involves techniques such as a ***"Man in The Middle Attack MITM"***, 
whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device which they control, then take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to gain access to the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place...). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps which can be exploited without any advanced networking knowledge. Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the webserver itself...
