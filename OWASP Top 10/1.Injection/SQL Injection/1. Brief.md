<h1>$${\color{red}SQL} \space {\color{Goldenrod}Injection } $$</h1>

***SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection***, mostly referred to as SQLi, is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. 

When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web application authentication methods to private or customer areas. 
This is why SQLi is one of the ***oldest web application vulnerabilities***, and it can also be the ***most damaging***.
