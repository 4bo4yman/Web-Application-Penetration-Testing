## Logging in as other users

We have managed to bypass the application's login screen, but with the former technique, we can only login as the first user returned by the database. By making use of the $nin operator, we are going to modify our payload so that we can control which user we want to obtain.

First, the $nin operator allows us to create a filter by specifying criteria where the desired documents have some field, not in a list of values. So if we would want to log in as any user except for the user admin, we could modify our payload to look like this:

This would translate to a filter that has the following structure:

```['username'=>['$nin'=>['admin'] ], 'password'=>['$ne'=>'aweasdf']]```

Which tells the database to return any user for whom the username isn't admin and the password isn't aweasdf. As a result, we are now granted access to another user's account.

Notice that the $nin operator receives a list of values to ignore. We can continue to expand the list by adjusting our payload as follows:

This would result in a filter like this:

```['username'=>['$nin'=>['admin', 'jude'] ], 'password'=>['$ne'=>'aweasdf']]```

This can be repeated as many times as needed until we gain access to all of the available accounts.
