# Basic HTTP Authentication

● Basic HTTP authentication is a simple authentication mechanism used in web applications and services to restrict access to certain resources or functionalities.

● It's considered "basic" because it's uncomplicated and relies on a straightforward username and password combination. However, it's important to note that basic HTTP authentication is not secure on its own when used over an unencrypted connection (HTTP).

● It should only be used over HTTPS to ensure that the credentials are transmitted securely.

# Digest HTTP Authentication
● HTTP Digest Authentication is an authentication mechanism used in web applications and services to securely verify the identity of users or clients trying to access protected resources.

● It addresses some of the security limitations of Basic Authentication by employing a challenge-response mechanism and hashing to protect user credentials during transmission.

● However, like Basic Authentication, it's important to use HTTPS to ensure the security of the communication.
