#### For this example, we'll be looking at a logic flaw within the authentication mechanism.

A lot of times what happens is that developers forgets to sanitize the ***input(username & password)*** given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection. However, we are going to focus on a vulnerability that happens because of a developer's mistake but is very easy to exploit i.e ***re-registration of an existing user***.

Let's understand this with the help of an example, say there is an existing user with the name admin and now we want to get access to their account so what we can do is try to re-register that username but with slight modification. We are going to enter ```" admin"```(notice the space in the starting). Now when you enter that in the username field and enter other required information like email id or password and submit that data. It will actually register a new user but that ***user will have the same right as normal admin***. That new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user admin.


ex :-

* First register darren acount create ```" darren"``` in username field :

</p> 

* Second sign with the acount username is ```" darren"```:

</p> 

* Now ,We login and capture the FLAG:
