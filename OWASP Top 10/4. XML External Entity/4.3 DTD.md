<h1>$${\color{blue}DTD}$$</h1>



Before we move on to start learning about XXE we'll have to understand what is DTD in XML.

DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

Let us try to understand this with the help of an example. Say we have a file named ```note.dtd``` with the following content:

```
<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>
```

Now we can use this DTD to validate the information of some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.


Ex: Below is given an XML document that uses ```note.dtd```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
    <to>falcon</to>
    <from>feast</from>
    <heading>hacking</heading>
    <body>XXE attack</body>
</note>
```

So now let's understand how that DTD validates the XML. Here's what all those terms used in ```note.dtd``` mean

  * !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
  * !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
  * !ELEMENT to - Defines the ```to``` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
  * !ELEMENT from - Defines the ```from``` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
  * !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the ```heading``` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
  * !ELEMENT body - Defines the ```body``` element to be of type "#PCDATA"

    > NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.
