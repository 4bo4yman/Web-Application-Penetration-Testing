# Web-Application-Penetration-Testing
Penetration testing of web applications can identify security vulnerabilities in databases, source code, and backend networks of web-based applications. It can not only identify vulnerabilities but also help prioritize them and provide solutions to mitigate them.

Web application penetration testing is used to find vulnerabilities in web-based applications. It uses a three-step process: 

  1. Reconnaissance—discovering information about web servers, operating systems, services, resources, and more used by the web application
  2. Discovery—finding vulnerabilities in the web applications and planning attack vectors to be used in the penetration test.
  3. Attack—exploiting a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the application or its data.
