# Header Rewrite

#### Some WAFs rewrite the HTTP headers. Usually these modify the ```Server header``` t deceive the attackers.
> example :

#### If request is non-hosile غير عدائي

--------------

# HTTP Response Code
#### Some WAFs modify the HTTTP response codes if the request is hostile; for example:

```mod_security (WAF)``` >> ```406 Not Acceptable``` this response while request is hostile.

```AQTRONIX WebKnight (WAF)``` >> ```999 No Hacking``` this response while request is hostile.


--------------

# HTTP Response Body
### It also possibe to detect the presence of the WAF plainly in the response body.


## HTTP Response Body: mod_security

# Close Connection

### An interesting feature supported by some WAFs is close connection.

It is useful in dropping the connection in the case the WAF detects a ```malicious request```.

### Close Connection: mod_security

Here is a possible implementation with mod_security to detect a ```brute force attack```.
